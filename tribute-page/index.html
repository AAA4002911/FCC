        <h3 style="text-align: center;">Here's a time line of Ada Lovelace's life:</h3>
        <br>
        <li>1815: On December 10, Augusta Ada Byron is born, only legitimate daughter of Lord George Gordan Byron, the poet, and Lady Anne Isabella Noel Byron, an education advocate.</li>
      <li>1828: At the age of 12, Ada Byron designs and begins to construct a flying machine. </li>
      <li>1833: Ada Byron meets Charles Babbage, mathematician, philosopher, inventor and mechanical engineer. They begin to collaborate and correspond by letter, and Babbage writes to a friend that he has met "the Enchantress of Number."</li>
      <li>1835: Ada Byron marries William King and adds King to her name. </li>
      <li>1836: On May 12, her first child, Byron, is born.</li>
      <li>1837: On September 22, her second child, Anna Isabella (Annabella) is born.
        <li>1838: Ada Byron King's husband is named Count of Lovelace and she becomes Ada Lovelace, the name by which she is most commonly known today.
          <li>1839: On July 2, her third child, Ralph Gordon, is born.</li>
          <li>1842-1843: Ada Lovelace translates, over the course of 9 months, the article by Luigi Menabrea, the Italian mathematician, on Babbage's proposed Analytical Machine. </li>
          <li>1843: Ada Lovelace adds a set of notes, around 3 times longer than the translation of Menabrea's paper. In the last section, she writes a complete method to solving for a Bernoulli sequence on the Analytical Engine, later found to be correct.</li>
          <li>1844: Ada Lovelace writes to a friend regarding her wish to mathematically model the brain, developing a "calculus of the nervous system."</li>
          <li>1851: Ada Lovelace attempts to derive a mathematical model to win large bets, but loses a great deal of money and must admit her gambling to her husband.</li>
          <li>1852: On November 27, Ada Lovelace dies from uterine cancer, exacerbated by bloodletting.</li>
          <li>1953: Ada Lovelace's notes on the Analytical Engine are republished, and she becomes known as the first writer of an algorithm specifically designed to run on a computer. </li>
      </ul>
